# SimpleFlashCards

This Android App allows the user to create flash cards that will be shown to the user for
review at increasing intervals over time; in other words, this is an SRS (spaced repetition system).

The UI is deliberately simple and allows users to enter cards to the card database via the 
"add cards" page. When the user starts the app, they can choose to study which will take them
to the study page. Then they must press the "Start" button to begin the session. Similar in design
to the popular flash card app AnkiDroid, the types of cards that are remaining are shown as counters
in the top-right of the screen, where the type of the current card is underlined.
(forgotten cards -- red; reviewing cards -- green; new cards -- blue) 

A demo of the project is hosted on this site under "Projects": https://daniel-mitchell011.github.io/mainPage.html

The code is heavily inspired by this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCSlZIUj18Y&t=29691s
